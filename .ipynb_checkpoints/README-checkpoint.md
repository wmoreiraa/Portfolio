# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 
Mostly presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, but that are full data science projects that are using the CookieCutter DS template.



_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._
_Note: All of my projects are NOT WORK RELATED since I work mostly with NDA._
