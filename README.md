# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. 
Mostly presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, but for full data science projects I would use the CookieCutter DS template.



_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

_Note: All of my projects are NOT WORK RELATED since I work mostly with NDA._

    - [Credit Card Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/wmoreiraa/Portfolio/blob/master/cc_customersegment.ipynb): The marketing team is trying to build a new sales strategy 
focused on deliverying the different campaings across customer segmentation. The data consists of 9000 rows of credit card holders behavioural features. To solve the problem Ive reduced the dimensionality using PCA and selected the optimal number of clusters using KMeans algorithm and the silhouette plot.
_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_
